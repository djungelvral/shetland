-- insert / delete rows & columns
-- divide a colour into two colours, splitting the cells that use that colour according to their locations. i.e. say if you wanted to make all blue cells after row 30 green, but keep the ones before row 30 blue
-- make background colour softer & change grid colour
-- make load more robust. Should work without reloading the page
-- copy / paste regions
	-- could have slave copies which retain link to original, and update when original section is changed
		-- or... all copies of the section could be equal, so editing one will change them all
-- hold down a key to temporarily use background colour, switch back to foreground on keyup
	-- more useful would be to swtich between foreground colour and some other colour, since fairisle rows usually involve two colours
-- table of all possible factorizations of a number, i.e. to see possible repeats that will fit into a certain size pattern
-- numbers across top
-- "clear all" button
-- ability to show / hide grid
-- tool to only overwrite certain colours
	-- or... option to 'hold' certain colours, i.e. so they can't be overwritten
-- key-controls: have a 'currrently selected' cell, and use the cursor keys to navigate around the grid. give each colour a number, and use the number keys to colour the currently selected cell.
