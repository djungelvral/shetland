Saving a pattern / loading a saved pattern
------------------------------------------

Currently, there is only a rudimentary load / save mechanism:

- To **save** a pattern:
    - Click `save` near the bottom of the toolbar
    - Copy the text that appears in the box (it's a JSON encoding of the pattern)
    - Paste the text into a text file on your computer, and save this file
- To **load** a pattern:
    - Open the file on your computer that you saved the pattern in
    - Copy the text
    - Paste the text into the box at the bottom of the toolbar
    - Click `load` to read the pasted text and recreate the pattern
